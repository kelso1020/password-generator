# password-generator

## Description

I edited this webpage used to create a working password generator. I added code to the javascript file that will result in prompts appearing on the webpage that ask the user for their prefered criteria in a password. When the prompts are followed and met, a new password will be generated on the webpage.

## Usage

This Password Generator webpage contains a 'Generate Password' button that, when clicked, will bring up a prompt for the webpage user asking how many characters they want their password to be. Once the character limit is met, the webpage will then prompt the user through choosing whether lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters are used in the generated password. When all the prompts are followed and criteria is met, the webpage will generate a password.
